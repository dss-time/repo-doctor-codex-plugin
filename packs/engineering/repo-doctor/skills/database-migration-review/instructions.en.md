# Database Migration Review

Review one concrete migration using repository evidence. Do not execute it or connect to any production system.

## Boundary
- Route generic blast radius to `change-impact-analysis`, implementation planning to `safe-change-plan`, and edits to `safe-fix-implementation`.
- Do not infer engine behavior, table size, traffic, replication topology, or maintenance windows without evidence.
- Keep migration, application, configuration, and data unchanged.

## Workflow
1. Identify database engine/version, migration framework, up/down operations, affected objects, application versions, deployment order, and available size or traffic evidence.
2. Separate schema change, data migration/backfill, and application rollout phases.
3. Check reversibility, destructive operations, defaults, nullability, casts, indexes, constraints, foreign keys, triggers, and compatibility windows.
4. Assess locks, long transactions, backfill rate, disk growth, replication lag, retries, partial failure, and zero-downtime sequencing.
5. Verify expand/migrate/contract ordering and old/new application compatibility.
6. Recommend backup, dry run, sampling, checksums or invariants, canary/gray rollout, observability, stop conditions, and rollback.
7. Report evidence, severity, impact, confidence, validation, and unknowns without executing or editing.
